mylightning.network began with a question.

"Can you tell me when and where should I deposit my hard-earned bitcoins for a counterparty risk-free interest rate return?"

It was 2017, and I was still working on my Ph.D. research on finding anomalous events at the University of Sydney. At that time, I came across a thing called bitcoin. My fellow researchers talked about bitcoin shooting to 25K USD, and people are becoming millionaires overnight.

Although I knew nothing about money, I was captivated by this new form of coins worth so much in dollars. So I started listening to Andreas Antonopoulos and read the bitcoin whitepaper, about 9 pages long; I must admit, I didn't understand even after several reads. But, like everybody, I was also excited to put in some dollars and turn rich. After being orange pilled by Max & Stacy it is hard for anyone to go off the hook of passion from Mr. Max, who was interviewing folks working on the lightning network and how their mission solved the bitcoin transaction speed problem. However, it is this fascinating blog from my favorite author Nik Bhatia, "Lightning Network will birth Lightning banks." captivated me, which led to the question I started with 

"Can you tell me to whom and where I should deposit my hard-earned bitcoins for a counterparty risk-free positive interest rate return?"


Firstly one must know when to lock in bitcoin since there is a cost associated with the Time Value of Bitcoin. 

To fully appreciate and understand the time value of bitcoin, I found it easy  if we compare it against other forms of money, especially the newest form of money, the Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), and its time value. This exploration of the time value of different forms of money inspired me to articulate and understand the inner working of other types of money, markets, and players involved from a Game Theory perspective.
