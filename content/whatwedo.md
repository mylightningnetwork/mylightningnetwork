mylightning.network began with a question.

"Can you tell me to whom and where I should deposit my hard-earned bitcoins for a counterparty risk-free interest rate return?"

It was 2017, and I was still working on my Ph.D. research on finding anomalous events at the University of Sydney. At that time, I came across a thing called bitcoin. My fellow researchers talked about bitcoin shooting to 25K USD, and people are becoming millionaires overnight.

Although I knew nothing about money, I was captivated by this new form of coins worth so much in dollars. So I started listening to Andreas Antonopoulos and read the bitcoin whitepaper, about 9 pages long; I must admit, I didn't understand even after several reads. But, like everybody, I was also excited to put in some dollars and turn rich.

However, during the lockdowns in 2020, Australia was too strict in enacting the covid restrictions; it then I really started thinking about money and how it all worked since I heard that the government was printing money :) Since people and businesses were not functioning and wanted to provide support for the lives and livelihoods of millions; after several hours of study and listening to people like Robert Breedlove, The hidden secrets of money by Mike Maloney, and of course, the entertaining Chico Crypto who was very creative and provided excellent research about crypto macro, I always was fascinated about Bitcoin and in fact created my own metaphor for bitcoin as El Florado or (Flowing Gold) :) 

After being orange pilled by Max & Stacy it is hard for anyone to go off the hook of passion from Mr. Max, who was interviewing folks working on the lightning network and how their mission solved the bitcoin transaction speed problem. However, it is this fascinating blog from my favorite author Nik Bhatia, "Lightning Network will birth Lightning banks." captivated me, which led to the question I started with 

"Can you tell me to whom and where I should deposit my hard-earned bitcoins for a counterparty risk-free positive interest rate return?"

I started reading about lightning networks and interacted with Rene Pickkart on Twitter to better understand how the lightning network works. I have been closely following the monthly devs meetup. I am delighted to see the passion and commitment to enhancing the capability of the lightning network through open source movement.

 I recently visited the Pacific Bitcoin conference in Los Angeles, where I got to meet and present with the great Michael Saylor himself about what I had built to answer the question. So let me explain by simplifying it.

Firstly one must know when to lock in bitcoin since there is a cost associated with the Time Value of Bitcoin. 

To fully appreciate and understand the time value of bitcoin, I found it easy  if we compare it against other forms of money, especially the newest form of money, the Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), and its time value. This exploration of the time value of different forms of money inspired me to articulate and understand the inner working of other types of money, markets, and players involved from a Game Theory perspective.
