# This is Carl Brown's Hugo port of a fork of Flexible-Jekyll

I use it on my own blog.  My [hugo](https://gohugo.io) port is [here](https://github.com/carlbrown/hugo-theme-flex-nojs) of the forked repo [which is here](https://github.com/carlbrown/flexible-jekyll) from the original [here](https://github.com/artemsheludko/flexible-jekyll).

# Below this is the original Jekyll info. Ingore it. I'll fix it later.

## Flexible-Jekyll is a simple and clean theme for Jekyll
